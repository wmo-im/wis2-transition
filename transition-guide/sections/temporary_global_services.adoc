=== GTS to WIS2 Gateway

The Executive Council, with resolution 34 (EC-76), endorsed the WMO Information System 2 (WIS2) implementation plan and recognized the importance of establishing a pilot phase to develop the WIS2 infrastructure and begin testing it in order to be ready for a preoperational phase in 2024, and then for the transition starting on 2025. According to the WIS2 implementation plan, the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) will be decommissioned by 2030, and National Meteorological and Hydrological Services NMHSs will use the WIS2 platform for data exchange.

During the transition period, in order to avoid some WIS centres being forced to run both data-sharing frameworks WIS2 and GTS simultaneously, with the challenges associated with maintaining two operational systems for the same purpose, a gateway from GTS to WIS2 is designed, taking into account the time required for Members to migrate to the new systems and minimizing the time a member has to operate both systems in parallel.

==== Purpose

The purpose of the GTS to WIS2 gateway is to enable members who have migrated to WIS2 and have stopped their GTS systems to continue receiving GTS data from WIS2. This gateway also enables users who are not connected to GTS to access GTS data, during the transition phase, from WIS2. The GTS to WIS2 gateway will forward all the GTS traffic it receives to WIS2, that is each bulletin received on one of its GTS channels will be stored to the HTTP(s) endpoint of the Gateway and a WIS2 Notification Message is generated which points to that bulletin file. The Notification Message is published at the GTS to WIS2 gateway topic.

==== GTS to WIS2 Gateway provider

The gateway will be provided by Germany's Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).
 
==== Technical requirements

* GTS headers SHALL be used in the WIS2 Topic Hierarchy (WTH)
* The TH for GTS data on WIS2 SHALL be as follows:
** ``origin/a/wis2/[GC-name]/data/[core|recommended]/T1/T2/A1/A2/ii/CCCC``
** e.g for DWD: ``origin/a/wis2/de-dwd-gts-to-wis2/data/[core|recommended]/T1/T2/A1/A2/ii/CCCC`` and for JMA: ``origin/a/wis2/jp-jma-gts-to-wis2/data/[core|recommended]/T1/T2/A1/A2/ii/CCCC``
* The GTS to WIS2 data is copied on the WIS2 Global Caches if the data is WMO Core Data.
* Each GTS to WIS2 Gateway SHALL maintain a list of TTAAii headers for Core and for Recommended data in order to be able to send the notification to the correct topic. The list is coordinated and shared between the Gateways.
* The data_id for each GTS to WIS2 Gateway SHALL be unique. That is each gateway will choose different data ids for example by adding their centre name reflecting the fact, that GTS bulletins with the same header might be different at the different locations. Therefore there will be two or more different GTS to WIS2 datasets (one for each gateway).
* Example for a valid GTS to WIS2 data id is ``wis2/de-dwd-gts-to-wis2/data/core/W/W/X/X/60/EDZW/WWXX60EDZW200900``
* Data Consumers receiving the GTS data through WIS2 will need to be able to handle duplicates. This is in line with the current practices of handling duplicate messages on the GTS.
* Access to recommended GTS data should be restricted to WMO members.


=== WIS2 to GTS Gateway

The WIS2 Implementation plan outlines a gradual transition of data exchange from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) to WIS2. The transition is expected to occur between 2025 and 2030. The GTS will be decommissioned once the transition is complete.  

Once a WIS centre has migrated from GTS to WIS2, subject to validation of readiness, the centre will cease to share data on the GTS. Consequently, during the transition period some data will be published on the GTS and some via WIS2. 

WIS centres will need data published via both systems.

To remove the need for WIS centres to operate both GTS and WIS2 systems in parallel, real-time data published via WIS2 will be automatically re-published onto the GTS. The system responsible is referred to as the *WIS2 to GTS Gateway*.

To ensure resilient operation there will be more than one WIS2 to GTS Gateway.

==== Purpose
The purpose of the WIS2 to GTS Gateway is to enable Members relying on the GTS, who are yet to migrate to WIS2, to receive operational data published via WIS2 that would otherwise be unavailable on the GTS.

**Note**: Only data that have been already published in GTS are concerned by this Gateway, New data will be available **only** on WIS2.

==== WIS2 to GTS Gateway operators
The gateway will be provided by designated Regional Telecommunication Hubs (RTH). These RTHs are: [TODO: Add the RTHs that will each operate a WIS2-to-GTS Gateway. Provisional list is: China, UK, Brazil.] 

==== Technical requirements
===== For Data Providers
A Member seeking to stop GTS transmission shall contact the WMO Secretariat, providing the following information:

. The proposed date that GTS transmission will stop.
. The WIS2 centre-id from which data destined for GTS transmission will be published.
. The GTS header CCCC code to be used for the bulletins published on their behalf.
. The list of GTS bulletins, and, where appropriate, their cut-off times, to be published by the Gateway on their behalf.  

Once the Secretariat is satisfied that the Member's WIS2 Node is operationally ready, they will confirm the date on which the Member will stop published to the GTS. On this date the WIS2 to GTS Gateways will take over.

When publishing a WIS2 Notification Message for data that should also be shared on the GTS, the Data Provider shall indicate the GTS Abbreviated Header (AHL) of the bulletin in which the data is to be published. 

This is done by including the ``gts`` property in the WIS2 Notification Message (see example below). This enables the WIS2 to GTS Gateway operator to easily identify data for republication on the GTS and the AHL of the associated bulletin.
  
[source,json]
-----
"properties": {
  â€¦
  "gts": {
       "ttaaii": "FTAE31",
       "cccc": "VTBB"
  }
}
-----

===== For WIS2 to GTS Gateway operators
A WIS2 to GTS Gateway operator shall operate the following components throughout the transition period:

. A WIS2 client application to retrieve data published on WIS2.
. A Message Switching System (MSS), with routing configuration to all other RTHs on the MTN.
. Connectivity with the GTS Main Trunk Network (MTN).

Each WIS2 to GTS Gateway shall republish data on behalf of all Members who have stopped publishing to the GTS.

When a Member requests to stop their GTS transmission, the Secretariat will provide the following information to each WIS2 to GTS Gateway operator:

. The ``centre-id`` of the WIS2 Node from which the data destined for GTS transmission will be published on WIS2.
. The GTS header **CCCC** code to be used when publishing bulletins on behalf of that WIS2 Node.
. The list GTS bulletins and cut-off times the Member requires to be published.

The Secretariat will set a mutually acceptable date for transfer of responsibility from Member to Gateways for GTS publication, allowing adequate set-up time for the Gateway operators. On that date, the Gateway operators will take over responsibility for publication of data on the GTS for the Member.

For each Member whose GTS transmission responsibility is passed to the WIS2 to GTS Gateway, the Gateway will: 

. Subscribe to notifications on the topic: ``cache/a/wis2/{centre-id}/data/core/#``, where ``{centre-id}`` refers to the WIS2 Node designated by the Member
. Add the **CCCC** code designated by the Member to the Gateway's publication __whitelist__.
. Complete configuration required in the MSS for each bulletin specified by the Member; e.g., set up the data import channel, set the cut-off time, etc. 

**Note**: To ensure resilient operation, the Gateway should subscribe to notification messages from multiple Global Brokers.

**Note**: During the transition period, other gateways will republish GTS data to WIS2. These __GTS to WIS2 Gateways__ will publish via a designated ``centre-id``. To avoid an infinite loop of republication, it is essential that a WIS2 to GTS Gateway **does not** subscribe to notification messages associated with a centre-id of a GTS to WIS2 Gateway.

For each WIS2 notification message received, the Gateway will:

. Parse the notification message, discarding it if:
.. The notification message is a duplicate.
.. The notification message refers to data that has already been republished by the Gateway.
.. The notification message does not include the ``gts`` property.
.. The value of the ``cccc`` property is not on the Gateway's publication whitelist.
. If the notification message was not discarded, then:
.. Parse the notification message to extract the **TTAAii** and **CCCC** which identifies the bulletin that the data should be published within.
.. Download the data indicated in the message, using the __canonical__ link if one is specified.
.. Pass the downloaded data file to the Gateway's MSS via the channel configured for the bulletin (**TTAAii**, **CCCC**). 

**Note**: the WIS2 to GTS Gateway should log and report failures. [TODO: elaborate on failure reporting]

The Gateway's MSS will process incoming data files, batching individual items into bulletins as per configuration, and publish those bulletins onto the GTS for onward distributed via RTHs on the MTN and beyond.

The Gateway's MSS will publish bulletin amendments / corrections where data arrives after the cut-off time.
