=== GTS to WIS2 Gateway

The Executive Council, with resolution 34 (EC-76), endorsed the WMO Information System 2 (WIS2) implementation plan and recognized the importance of establishing a pilot phase to develop the WIS2 infrastructure and begin testing it in order to be ready for a preoperational phase in 2024, and then for the transition starting on 2025. According to the WIS2 implementation plan, the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) will be decommissioned by 2033, and National Meteorological and Hydrological Services NMHSs will use the WIS2 platform for data exchange.

During the transition period, in order to avoid some WIS centres being forced to run both data-sharing frameworks WIS2 and GTS simultaneously, with the challenges associated with maintaining two operational systems for the same purpose, a gateway from GTS to WIS2 is designed, taking into account the time required for Members to migrate to the new systems and minimizing the time a member has to operate both systems in parallel.

==== Purpose

The purpose of the GTS to WIS2 gateway is to enable Members who have migrated to WIS2 and have stopped their GTS systems to continue receiving GTS data from WIS2. This gateway also enables users who are not connected to GTS to access GTS data, during the transition phase, from WIS2. The GTS to WIS2 gateway will forward the GTS traffic it receives to WIS2. In accordance with the WIS2 specification, every data received on one GTS link will be stored on a HTTP(s) endpoint of the Gateway and will generate a WIS2 Notification Message. 

==== GTS to WIS2 Gateway provider

To ensure resilient operation, there will be more than one GTS to WIS2 Gateway.
 
==== Technical requirements

* A GTS to WIS2 gateway is a DCPC function. All requirements related to WIS2 Nodes are applicable. A GTS to WIS2 gateway will obtain from the WMO Secretariat a specific unique centre-id.
* In addition to the standard WIS2 Node specifications, the GTS to WIS2 gateway will support the following:
** The Topic Hierarchy for GTS data on WIS2 will be:
*** ``origin/a/wis2/{centre-id}/data/[core|recommended]/T1/T2/A1/A2/ii/CCCC``
*** e.g for DWD: ``origin/a/wis2/de-dwd-gts-to-wis2/data/[core|recommended]/T1/T2/A1/A2/ii/CCCC`` and for JMA: ``origin/a/wis2/jp-jma-gts-to-wis2/data/[core|recommended]/T1/T2/A1/A2/ii/CCCC``
** The ``T1/T2/A1/A2/ii/CCCC`` above is derived from the headers of the data received on the GTS.
* The Global Caches will cache data that is being published using ``core`` in the Topic Hierarchy.
* Data Consumers receiving the GTS data through WIS2 will need to be able to handle duplicates. This is consistent with the current practices of handling duplicate messages on the GTS.
* Access to recommended GTS data should be restricted to WMO members.
* Each GTS to WIS2 Gateway maintains a list of TTAAii headers for recommended data in order to be able to send the notification to the correct topic. The list is coordinated and shared between the gateway operators.

=== WIS2 to GTS Gateway

The WIS2 Implementation plan outlines a gradual transition of data exchange from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) to WIS2. The transition is expected to occur between 2025 and 2030. The GTS will be decommissioned once the transition is complete.  

==== Purpose

When a NMC centre, running a Message Switching System and exchanging data on the GTS, has implemented WIS2, it may want to stop sending its data directly on the GTS so that it can stop the Message Switching System (MSS). 

The WIS2 to GTS gateway will ensure that *only the data currently available on the GTS* and whose Member is wishing to stop its MSS will be re-published onto the GTS, so that no data is loss during the transition. 

To ensure resilient operation, there will be more than one WIS2 to GTS Gateway.

==== WIS2 to GTS Gateway operators
The gateway will be provided by designated Regional Telecommunication Hubs (RTH). 

==== Technical requirements
===== For WIS Centres wishing to stop their MSS

A Member planning to stop GTS transmission shall
* provide their data in conformance with WIS2 Node operations on WIS2
* for data that has previously been available on the GTS and that should continue to be available on the GTS
** indicate the GTS Abbreviated Header Line (AHL) of the bulletin in which the data is to be published.
** this is done by including the ``gts`` property in the WIS2 Notification Message (see example below). 

The ``gts`` property enables the WIS2 to GTS Gateway operator to easily identify data for republication on the GTS and the AHL of the associated data.

  "gts": {
       "ttaaii": "FTAE31",
       "cccc": "VTBB"
  }
}

For core data, the Global Cache will ensure their normal operation and the data to be relayed onto the ``gts`` will be available on the Global Cache.
For recommended data, WIS Centre should allow unrestricted access from the gateways. They will inform WMO Secretariat, so that the gateway will establish the required subscriptions. 

===== For WIS2 to GTS Gateway operators
A WIS2 to GTS Gateway operator shall operate the following components throughout the transition period:

. A Data Consumer to retrieve data published on WIS2. All Data Consumer specifications apply to the WIS2 to GTS Gateway.
. A Message Switching System (MSS) with the required configuration to reach all RTHs.
. In addition, the gateway shall implement a mechanism so that the Data Consumer part can make available the data to be sent onto the GTS with the required TTAAii and CCCC to the local MSS. The Gateway's MSS will process incoming data files, batching individual items into bulletins as per standard configuration, and publish those bulletins onto the GTS for onward distribution via RTHs on the MTN and beyond.

The mechanism depends on local implementation choices and may defer from one gateway to another.

Over the transition period, the list of TTAAii/CCCC to relay from WIS2 to GTS will grow when new NMC plan to stop their MSS.
It means, that the gateway will require a method to allow the addition of batches of TTAAii/CCCC when new Centres are ready for the transition.

As it is expected for Data Consumers, and to ensure resilient operation, the Gateway should subscribe to notification messages from multiple Global Brokers.

During the transition period, other gateways will republish GTS data to WIS2. These __GTS to WIS2 Gateways__ will publish via a designated ``centre-id``. To avoid an infinite loop of republication, it is essential that a WIS2 to GTS Gateway **does not** subscribe to notification messages associated with a centre-id of a GTS to WIS2 Gateway.

== Stopping a Message Switching System

Thanks to the gateway functions described in previous chapter, WIS Centres currently using the GTS to exchange operational data, after having successfully implementing a WIS2 Node with the additional features required for the gateways to provide the gateway service, will be able to stop their Message Switching System, if they wish to do so, before the end of the complete migration.
Gradually stopping all the MSS shall be done in an orderly and coordinated manner so that all data required by Members for their operations will continue to be available.

The "Management of WIS1 and GTS" section of this Transition Guide recalls the various roles on the GTS (NMC, RTH, WMC). It also details when a Centre can stop its MSS. When all the conditions for a Centre are met, the following decommissioning procedure can be applied.

The sequence diagram details the list of actions required and the role of the various entities involved in this action.
*The responsible GISC for the Centre will have a key role to play.* The GISC will have to ensure that the Centre has properly implemented the requirements and that the procedure is well understood by the Centre so that, no data is lost during the transition.
WMO secretariat will act as the coordination body between all parties.
It is crucial that all parties to strictly follow the agreed procedure.

It must also be noted that the final switch (stopping the MSS by the Centre and activating the gateway function for the TTAAii/CCCC of the WIS Centre) will happen at the same moment. The exact time and date will be chosen by the various parties under the control of WMO Secretariat.

Upon request by a Centre, WMO Secretariat will inform the gateways when a new ``centre-id`` wishes to use the relay function as well as the required subscription topics. When requested by WMO Secretariat, the gateway will implement the following subscriptions:

. Subscribe to notifications on the topic: ``+cache/a/wis2/{centre-id}/data/#+``, where ``{centre-id}`` refers to a WIS2 Node wishing to stop the native GTS function. 
. Potentially subscribe to  ``+origin/a/wis2/{centre-id}/data/recommended/#+`` for the WIS2 Node having also recommended data on the GTS.

*Important* Subscribing to these topics shouldn't imply pushing the data onto the ``gts`` immediately. Making the data available on the ``gts`` will require the explicit approval from WMO Secretariat. It is up to the gateway operators to implement this "kill switch" (eg. disabling the subscription, blocking the flow between the Data Consumer and the MSS for those TTAAii/CCCC only, ...)
